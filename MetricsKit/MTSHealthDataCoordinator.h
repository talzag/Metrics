/**
 Contains the logic for determining which health data can be grouped together.
 This is useful when looking at related types of data. For example, a user could group
 HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBasalEnergyBurned and HKQuantityTypeIdentifierActiveEnergyBurned
 together, then subtract HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietaryEnergyConsumed to see their "real" 
 calorie count for a given time period.

 Determines whether the data of one MTSHealthData instance can be combined with the the data of
 another MTSHealthData instance and treated as a single set of data to be graphed. Currently the 
 only data that can be combined is health data related to calories:
 
 Base Calories Burned + Active Calories Burned - Dietary Calories Consumed = Real Calorie difference
